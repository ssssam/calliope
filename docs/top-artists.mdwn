# Finding your most listened artists

The Spotify online streaming service can provide a list of the artists
you listen to the most on that platform. See the list with:

    cpe spotify top-artists

Using `cpe tracker` you can get a list of the top artists in your local
music collection. This is sorted by the number of tracks you have by that
artists rather than by how much you have listened to them:
