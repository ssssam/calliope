# Follow your top artists on Twitter

First you need to get a list of your [most listened artists](top-artists.mdwn).

Now pipe that list to `cpe musicbrainz --include urls` and you'll get a list
of relationship URLs for each artist.

Finally, pipe that into `jq`:

    jq '. | ."musicbrainz.artist.urls" // [] | .[]."musicbrainz.url.target" | "@" + match("^http[s]?://(www\\\.)?twitter.com/(.*)").captures[1].string' -r |sort -u

Now you have a list of Twitter handles. Using a tool such as
[t (Twitter CLI)](https://github.com/sferik/t) you can add all these handles to
a list, or you can just follow all of them directly. Note that you have to fill
in a bunch of forms in order to get a Twitter API key before you can use a
Twitter CLI tool. The `t authorize` command will point you in the right
direction.
