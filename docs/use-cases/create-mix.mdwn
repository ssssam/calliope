# Creating mixes

You can use Calliope to create simple audio mixes.

Start by writing a playlist as a .yaml file. If you don't want to fill in the
`location` fields yourself you can pipe the playlist to `cpe tracker annotate`
to find the files for you.

Alternately, you can create a playlist in Rhythmbox, export it to a `.pls` file
and then pipe to `cpe import` to convert to Calliope format.

Then pipe the playlist to `cpe play -o mix.wav`. You will get all the tracks
mixed into a single audio file named `mix.wav`. On stdout you will get the
playlist with extra `start-time` fields, which can be piped to `cpe export` to
create a CUE sheet for the mix.
