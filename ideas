Things to make:

* List your local music collection by your last.fm listening history

  - Show most listened, least listened, and unlistened tracks.

* Browse your local music collection by tag

  - Could fork gnome-music for this ?

* Browse your local music collection by last.fm tags

  - Sync last.fm tags with Tracker tags also kind of related -- not
    sure I want it?

* Explore music geographically -- find bands from the same area that
  you know or that are related to bands you know

* Explore music by record label -- find other bands on the same label
  as bands you know

* Import Spotify playlists locally (doesn't need to be with Tracker
   though -- m3u files are fine.)

  - 2-way sync would be even better.


Other thoughts:

- Add these as features to gnome-music ?

- What about remote music? i.e. DAAP shares from a media server.

   - gnome-music uses Grilo, so if you can add a DAAP grilo plugin you
     should do OK. Some level of caching in the DAAP plugin would be pretty
     handy.

   - for tracker-specific code... you really would need to import the
     DAAP data into the tracker-store somehow, as a kind of removable
     device.

      -> probably the app itself should handle this.
