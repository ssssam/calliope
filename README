CALLIOPE MUSIC PLAYER

Dependencies:
	
	- Iris: http://git.dronelabs.com/iris/
          * This is a very young project so is currently distributed with
            Calliope. It will be removed once stable tarballs start being
            released.
Requires:  FIXME: versions?
GNOME I guess
sqlite3
gstreamer
etc.

Building:
	./waf configure
	./waf build

Testing:
	./waf check


Calliope used to use automake but now it uses waf, which is of course less mature
but much, much more concise!

A few files are autogenerated by the 'conftool' program which is written in
LISP. I have only tested it in CLISP but I'm pretty sure it is all ANSI.

conftool needs to be run sometime before waf, so the way I set up a
build is:

	./conftool  (or on win32, /c/tools/clisp/clisp conftool
	./waf configure --enable-debugging (or not)
	./waf build
	./waf install

If you are building from a tarball only the last 3 steps are necessary.


CD PLAYBACK: cdio/cdparanoia, libcdio, gst, etc. ..

SCROBBLER: file locking on scrobblerqueue - nfs may not work right !!

Windows: Windows 2000/NT4+

Libraries
-------------------------------


* For testing
DUMA: http://duma.sourceforge.net/


Source code directory structure
-------------------------------

* lib/
	This is for code that is probably stolen from other places and should really be some shared library.

* src/base
	Largely abstract base classes

* src/lib
	Code that is fairly generic and reuseable, but not actually of much use outside Calliope (where lib/ is for
	code that is useful for all sorts of apps.

* src/core
	Backend.

* src/ui
	Frontend.
