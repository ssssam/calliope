There are two parts. BUCKET and FUNNEL

The BUCKET contains all the stuff I ever listened to. This should be pulled in
from:
    - Youtube history
    - last.fm history
    - Spotify playlists

The FUNNEL contains stuff I want to hear in the future because someone said it
was good. This should be pulled in from:
    - pinboard.in bookmarks tagged to:listen
    - starred things on Spotiy
    - local music that Tracker finds on your computer

Storage:

CREATE TABLE import_pinboard (
    account_id,
    bookmark_id,
    item_id,
)

CREATE TABLE import_spotify (
    account_id,
    playlist_id,
    item_id
)

CREATE TABLE import_tracker (
    computer_uuid,
    uri,
)

CREATE TABLE import_youtube (
    /* ... */
)

Some ideas for views
--------------------

BUCKET:

- ... how is this different to the info last.fm gives you?

- how about: tracks in order of LAST listen?
