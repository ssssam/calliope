Calliope 9999
-------------

Think of this as a set of tool which operates on playlists or collections of
music.

Obviously that's a bit shit for the average user, but hopefully it's the
building blocks of cool stuff.

The canonical representation of a playlist or collection will be a YAML file
containing a list of identifiers for artists, albums and/or songs.

There will be several tools that operate on this data.

  calliope-tracker:
    - optionally takes playlist or collection as input
    - can output:
        - playlist with actual file:/// URIs for tracks that don't have them.
        - total file size
        - list of files that couldn't be located
    - can also dump the whole local collection
    - or filter by tag

  calliope-lastfm:
    - syncs last.fm listening history to a local database
    - outputs top artists, albums, or songs, in playlist/collection format

  calliope-spotify:
    - outputs spotify playlists in playlist/collection format
    - I guess you should be able to modify existing ones too really!

  calliope-daap:
    - like calliope-tracker but using a remote DAAP server
    -> is that really useful ?

  Other ideas: calliope-youtube, calliope-mixcloud

To do interesting stuff, you can combine and compare playlists using jq and
y2j, perhaps.

Examples of cool stuff you can do.

* Browse your music collection by *familiarity*. Order songs on your
  PC (as returned by calliope-tracker) by most-listened, or least-listened.

* Shuffle your music; you could add a duration limit to calliope-tracker's
  playlist output, and a --shuffle option.

----

As a separate tool, Charango could provide a GUI view of this sort of thing.
It could maybe even play the playlists... no that's too crazy

Main purpose would be to make tagging easier: that's a pain in the ass from the
commandline. Or you could write a separate CLI tagging tool .... 'accordion' is
a nice name that I want to use for something :-) Attaching notes to tunes would
also be nice.

What about writing rhythmbox plugins with various different views?

 - world map (shuffle play artists from a given place)
 - ...

Or simple last.fm/whatever sites?

 - your artists ranked by global popularity ... i.e. what artists you listen
   to that everyone else does. Mainstream finder.

General and some specific goals
-------------------------------

 * Build open tools that you can play with and understand; unlike the opaque
   recommendation algorithms provided by YouTube and Spotify

 * Create a feedback loop for new music that you've found so that things
   don't "fall between the cracks"

 * Find new music by exploring similarities from artists you already like,
   e.. same location, same tag, same record label.

 * Organize a mess of MP3 files on disk into something neat; and allow
   creating symlink indexes
